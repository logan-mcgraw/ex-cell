# ex-cell
A little program I made to save me ~5-10 minutes per day at work copying data by hand. Written using Python 3.6 and openpyxl (https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). 

Honestly it's probably pretty clunky, but it works and that's all I really care about.

The program right now is specific to the formatting of two spreadsheets I use at work, obviously I can't share these, but the specific cells to be copied are pretty easily changed.
